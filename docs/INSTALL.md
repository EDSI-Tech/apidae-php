# Install

## Via Composer

    composer require apidae-tourisme/apidae-php

## Standalone (when you can't use Composer)

- Download sources from git repository
- Extract the ZIP file and add the whole "vendor" directory to your project;
- Include the file `vendor/autoload.php` if you do not have an autoloader already.

However we **strongly** encourage you to [use Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) on all your projects.
